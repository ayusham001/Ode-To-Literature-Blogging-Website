            Come sit in this twilight beside me, my darling.<br>
            Tell me those stories as you always do,<br>
            The stories of our fears and our fantasies,<br>
            And you of us, that has been due on you.<br>
<br>
            Sing me those lores while I watch the stars<br>
            Which reflect themselves utterly into my eyes and yours,<br>
            Talk to me of the love we share<br>
            And we'll watch, how then my heart cures,<br>
<br>
            Listening you peach 'bout the past, the future; The past of holding hands and assembling lips,<br>
            Of the struggles and the mess that became ours<br>
            And that will rest ours, until the apocalypse.<br>
<br>
            So, when you see our faces decipher into that dark<br>
            Hold hard my hand then, and lyric to me further,<br>
            The future of our shared dusks and dawns,<br>
            Of the love and the happiness dealt together.<br>
<br>
            Then, I'll narrate you the places we'll wander 'n' polaroid,<br>
            The verses and vocals that I'll sing you someday.<br>
            Now, just gaze at me, as you once before did<br>
            And let me feel your heat, all the while you stay.<br>
<br>
            Then on the closure, we'll stir our eyes to the east,<br>
            At last keeping the quiet to see<br>
            The sun come up, yet ever serene<br>
            And so like us, forever untamed and free.<br>
