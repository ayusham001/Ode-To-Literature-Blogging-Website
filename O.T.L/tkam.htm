'Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'
A lawyer's advice to his children as he defends the real mockingbird of Harper Lee's classic novel "To Kill a Mockingbird". The book orbits around and through Scout and Jem Finch, while their father fend for a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. Harper Lee shows us via words and humor the unreasonability of adult attitudes to race and class in the deep South of the 1930s.

This book  will mark on a reader something that will stay for a long time with them, the father of two children, a lawyer who struggles for a man's justice and at the same time educates his children in a way that impacts one's mind as well as the heart. The characters in this novel seem nothing but as real as the ripples of water that submerges the reader and makes the book unputdownable. The story not only includes a plot but also these little incidents which make it so lively to never let the reader feel that what it is are mere words. As for me, parts of it really made me giggle and some others made me cry too. 

Although, it was essential for the book to mention the minute scenes it contains, the reader might feel that it is rendering the story it's slow pace, but it only awards the reader with the essence of the story in the liveliest sense of life. Also, the book is a bit difficult for beginners because the author stresses on the accent of the characters through spellings and punctuations. With everything considered, I would surely recommend it to the ardent reader community and fans of Gothic fiction.

Note: "Go set a watchman" is said to be it's sequel but many think it's just an early draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird" because of the repeated phrases in the former.
