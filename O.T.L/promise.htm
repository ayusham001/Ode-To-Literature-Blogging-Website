<br>
                You asked me for a forever,<br>
                Which I can't ever promise.<br>
                But in time I wanted to be yours,<br>
                Yet you, to be mine.<br>
                So, I wrote a poem about us,<br>
                A poem about the brown of your eyes;<br>
                Which when the sun falls on<br>
                Shines like that of a wolf's,<br>
                Who's been in love since Christ.<br>
                About the rays of its gaze,<br>
                Which renders me a beauty<br>
                As if it's itself Aphrodite.<br>
                <br>
                I composed too, out of your curled lashes<br>
                A rhythm of two intermitted waves;<br>
                The ones that makes my heart race,<br>
                Through the love and<br>
                My sweetest envious wonder<br>
                That I took to them everytime, whenever.<br>
                <br>
                In the verses played also a child;<br>
                The child whom, in yourself you possess,<br>
                So naturally and so effortless.<br>
                The innocence of whom<br>
                Was shaped by Astraea herself,<br>
                The innocence that I always want to protect.<br>
                <br>
                But then the poem turned long enough<br>
                That I halted and recited it to you,<br>
                I told and retold<br>
                For the world to hear it too.<br>
                And when it ended I promised my forever,<br>
                I burned the pages of you and me<br>
                Turning us into embers<br>
                That will fly ever together.<br>
