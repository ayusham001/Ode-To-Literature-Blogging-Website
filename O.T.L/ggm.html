                This rudimentary sentence is evidently the last few lines of the novel " One Hundred Years of Solitude '', indited by Gabriel Gracía Márquez. The novel, earning him the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature, is a neat example of magical realism, a genre that puts us into a rather realistic world with some unearthly events, like characters simply levitating and floating away into heaven or having yellow butterflies hovering over their head until death.
                
                The book spirals up depicting the lives of seven generations of the Buendía family, who founded and lived in a small village of Macondo which had its own initial years of Solitude, the essence of the book. Gracía Márquez gave us a beautiful conglomeration of romance, politics, civil wars, calamities, ghosts and gypsies, all amongst the same sky of solitude.
                
                The events of Macondo entwine with the events of Columbia such as the "Banana Company Massacre" which resembles the "Banana Massacre" of 1928. The author's ink spilled on the pages and drew a pattern of Colombian and Latin American history that we see in the book throughout the biography of the characters.
                With its sumptuously written sentences and large cast of characters the book entitled itself as "not so easy to read", moreover, the tangled narrative of the same names and alternating timelines makes it a little confusing but nonetheless more rewarding. 
                
                "One Hundred Years of Solitude" is not the kind of book that you can peek in between the pages to guess the course of its story or jump to the last chapter to know the ending or skip sentences of, it's a book that you complete at 2 a.m. on some random day and go on to contemplate the concept for weeks. And as for the ending, I wouldn't say the climax was obvious or a total captivation but true to the story and surely the chocolate filled ending to your dessert cone. 
                I wouldn't recommend this book to the beginners but it's definitely one of the best reads of my life up until now. 
                
                Author related facts: The village of Macondo was inspired by the Author's grandparents village, Aracataca. 
                Gabriel Gracía Márquez grew up in Columbia during the war between the Conservative and the Liberal parties.
                The idea for his Award winning book came to him while he was driving his family to their destination (which they never reached because he returned to write this novel) for their vacation.</p>
