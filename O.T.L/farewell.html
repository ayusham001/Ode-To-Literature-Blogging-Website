There is no love now, not for me, not for you." I said.

                The alarm goes off, a song plays, one of my favorites, but whatever the song might be, alarms are always annoying. It is 5 in the morning; I turn off the alarm, and a big blow of reality hits; I have been crying last night too? I don't really remember these days. But I do remember why I set the alarm this early and why I am here in my native townlet. So, I drag myself and my heaviness out the bed, walking slowly, with my head pounding from all the crying of the twilight, grabbing my shawl; I yawn like a chimpanzee and go to the kitchen to prepare my special tea on the special clay stove. All this dew has made the logs wet; I manage to ignite them and put up my special tea to be made as I watch the flames, crimson orange...looking like a ruby corundum, serene, but I dare not touch it because nobody's a fool enough to take embers for ambers or rubies, yet wasn't your love like that; An ember that burned my heart yet I mistook it for a gem…
                
                ..."What do you mean he proposed to you and you let him do that? I am telling you Isha, you will pay for all this frankness of yours one day, you will cry, and even I won't be there to console you"..." You always do this, go out making guy friends and then when they grow feelings for you or hurt you, you come cry to
                me"..."What words of endearment do you want for yourself? Our parents have named us aren't you happy with that"..."Don't you use those slangs with me, m your
                boyfriend and not some guy you call your friend"...
                
                ...and the tea is ready. I pour it into a cup and move out to take a look at the curative I woke so early for. I climb up on the patio, the stairs are all mossy, makes it look vintage...any-which-way I reach where I had to, a decision and I was here to talk, not to
                anyone else but myself, only that's for later.
                
                There is fog, yet it's as beautiful as it used to be, behind the cropland, on the skyline a scarlet hue of shine, the sunrise...therapeutic as ever. I watch the dawn of a new day, a new day indeed, wherein I will finally question myself if it was all worth it? And if it was, when did it stop being? I have the answers, my heart knows, and the sun rises, the fog is clearing. Sitting there for a while, I finally gathered the courage to call the boy I have loved so dearly for the past three years, such boyish looks he had when I fell for him, meek: both his personality and him. I call him, it's quarter to 7, he wakes up early unlike me, so he picks up, wretchedly, he answers " Hello, Good morning
                Isha."
                I respond with a weak and slow greeting.
                "What happened you called so early."
                ...silence…
                "Hello, are you still there? What happened"
                "I am empty."</p>
