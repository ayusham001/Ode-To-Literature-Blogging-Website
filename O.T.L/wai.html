                I, am a lover;
                A kind that you'd find in between the aisles of a library, written into an old, rusty book, covered with dust and spider web, sitting on a shelf of bestsellers of an age that had been when, had been the people who wrote poems of love and loss with flower ink and feathers.
                
                A kind that you'd find in between the hallways of a museum, carved into an ancient statuette marked with shabby numbers now, standing on a pedestal made of rocks from an elder Era that existed when, existed the people who ate their supper in silverware lest from the hands of their lover.
                
                A kind that you'd find in upon the walls of an art gallery, stroked into a stale, now-yellowed oil painting fastened scruffily with iron nails, hanging through a canvas woven with hemp from the years that breathed when breathed the people who colored the smiles and scars of love on ground pigments.
                
                I am a lover from a different age.
                An age where I was a poetess and a poetry, reciting myself to the one.
                An Era where I was a sculptress and a sculpture, letting feel the rise and ridges of myself to the one.
                The years where I was an artist and an art of oil, showing and scenting myself to the one.
                
                To the one, To you.</p>
