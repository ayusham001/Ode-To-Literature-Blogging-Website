                You're worried about your nose?<br>
                And worried about how you<br>
                Never in your life got a rose?<br>
                <br>
                But what about those white flowers? <br>
                That I once gave you<br>
                For your eyes reminded me of the stars<br>
                Which they still, and will always do.<br>
                <br>
                The white flowers were the closest<br>
                Most beautiful thing that I could find<br>
                Next to your eyes; the star dust,<br>
                Of wintery white glimmer kind.<br>
                <br>
                You're worried about your teeth?<br>
                And worried about how you<br>
                Never in your life have seen a heath?<br>
                <br>
                But what about those piddly places?<br>
                That we travelled together, hand in hand<br>
                For your palms felt like the good graces<br>
                Of the warm summer sand.<br>
                <br>
                The excuses I made to hold them,<br>
                And keep holding onto, like an infant<br>
                Holding its mother's clothing hem,<br>
                And keeping forever its sweetly scent.<br>
                <br>
                You're worried about what?<br>
                And you're worried why?<br>
                Don't you see my thoughts<br>
                And how your insecurities are a lie?<br>
